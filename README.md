**Boston Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

This project involves building a linear regression model to predict housing prices in the suburbs of Boston. The dataset contains various attributes related to housing characteristics, including crime rate, proximity to employment centers, property tax rate, and more. The goal is to understand the relationship between these features and the median value of owner-occupied homes.

This work is part of the AI/ML course curriculum at Delhi Technological University, aiming to provide hands-on experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world data. By implementing linear regression, the project demonstrates fundamental concepts such as feature selection, model evaluation, and performance metrics, offering insights into how statistical models can be utilized for predictive analysis in the housing market.
